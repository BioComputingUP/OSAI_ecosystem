# Contributing to the Open and Sustainable AI (OSAI) Ecosystems Components List

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document outlines how to contribute to the OSAI Ecosystems Components List, a community-curated GitHub of AI resources that support sustainable, FAIR and Open AI.

We primarily use a GitHub-based workflow. Contributions are made via Pull Requests (PRs) which are then reviewed and merged by the project maintainers.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues or Suggesting Resources
If you find an error, want to suggest a new resource without creating a Pull Request yourself, or have an idea for improving the list's structure:

1.  **Check existing issues:** See if someone has already reported the same thing or made a similar suggestion.
2.  **Create a new issue:** If not, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_OSAI_REPO/issues) (replace with your actual repository link).
    * Provide a clear title and description.
    * For new resources, explain how it supports fair and open AI.
    * Include links if applicable.

### Submitting Changes via Pull Requests
This is the preferred way to add or modify resources on the list.

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own copy of the [OSAI Ecosystems Components List repository](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_OSAI_REPO) (replace with your actual repository link) on GitHub.
2.  **Create a Branch:** In your forked repository, create a new branch for your changes (e.g., `add-new-tool-xyz` or `fix-typo-in-abc`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b name-of-your-new-branch
    ```
3.  **Make Your Changes:**
    * Add your new resource(s) or make corrections to the relevant Markdown file(s).
    * Ensure each entry is clear, concise, and provides necessary links.
    * Briefly explain (in the item description or PR) how the resource supports fair and open AI.
4.  **Commit Your Changes:**
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "feat: Add resource XYZ"
    ```
    (Use a clear commit message, e.g., "feat: Add XYZ tool for bias detection", "fix: Correct link for ABC dataset").
5.  **Push to Your Fork:**
    ```bash
    git push origin name-of-your-new-branch
    ```
6.  **Open a Pull Request:**
    * Go to the original OSAI Ecosystems Components List repository on GitHub.
    * You should see a prompt to create a Pull Request from your new branch. Click it.
    * Provide a clear title and a brief description of your changes in the PR. Explain the relevance of your added resource(s) to fair and open AI.
    * Submit the Pull Request.

## What to Contribute
We welcome contributions that add or improve:

* **AI Resources:** Links and brief descriptions of tools, datasets, frameworks, platforms, libraries, research papers, or educational materials that can be used to support fair, transparent, ethical, and open AI development and deployment.
* **Corrections:** Fixes for typos, broken links, or outdated information.
* **Categorization/Organization:** Suggestions or PRs that improve the structure and findability of the list (discuss via an issue first for major changes).

When adding a resource, please consider its relevance to:
* Transparency and Explainability (XAI)
* Bias detection and mitigation
* Fairness and equity in AI
* Privacy-preserving AI techniques
* Open-source AI models and tools
* Ethical AI guidelines and best practices
* Accessibility in AI

## What Not to Contribute
* Resources that are primarily commercial without a significant free/open tier or component directly supporting open and sustainable AI.
* Content that is off-topic or does not align with the goals of promoting fair and open AI.
* Changes to the project's core infrastructure files (e.g., GitHub Actions workflows, `.gitattributes`) without prior discussion with maintainers.
* Promotional material disguised as resources.

## Contribution Licensing
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project's license (e.g., CC-BY-4.0 or MIT - *please specify your chosen license here*). All contributed content must respect the copyrights of others.

## Review Process
Project maintainers will review Pull Requests.
* We aim to review contributions promptly.
* Feedback or requests for changes may be made via comments on the Pull Request.
* Once a PR is approved, a maintainer will merge it into the `main` branch.

We appreciate your contributions to building a valuable resource for the Open and Sustainable AI community!
