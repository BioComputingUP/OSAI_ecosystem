# Introduction

This page contains set of criteria to help community curators determine if something is suitable for our TSV maintained **OSAI Ecosystem components list**.

This list is not intended to be exclusive, but capture all relevant components that can be mapped to community recommendation/guidance frameworks to support FAIR, Open, Sustainable, Responsible, Green, + AI. This mapping will support practical implemntations and can be hosted on community supported resources.

An example hosting of this tool list can be found on [ELIXIR's DOME website](https://dome-ml.org/ai-ecosystem). Howeverm we hope it can be reused and adapted for other scientific domains or global regions where recommendation and guidance frameworks differ.

# Initial category of AI resource captured:

- AI/ML Library (e.g. Scikit-learn)
- Analysis platform (e.g. Google Colab)
- Benchmarking (e.g. DREAM Challenge)
- Best practice (e.g. Bridge2AI recommendations)
- Code sharing (e.g. GitHub)
- Database (e.g. Zenodo)
- LLM (e.g. ChatGPT 3)
- Metadata (e.g. Croissant)
- Organisation (e.g. ML Commons)
- Paper (e.g. Community-developed checklists for publishing images and image analyses)
- Project (e.g. ELSA: European Lighthouse on Secure and Safe AI)
- Registry (e.g. Ersilia Model Hub)
- Reproducibility tool (e.g. Bioconda)
- Standard (e.g. Schema.org)
- Tool (e.g. Green Algortihms)
- Training (e.g. Coursera)
- Visualisation tool (e.g. TensorBoard)
- Other (e.g. **anything not within the other categories above**)
